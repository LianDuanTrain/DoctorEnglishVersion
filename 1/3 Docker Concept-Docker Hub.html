Many websites now provide docker image downloads, but the largest image download website is Docker hub. 
We can search images and download from Docker hub.
 If you are a registered user, not only can you download the image file, but also you can also upload your docker image file to share with others.
Recommended, you register for an account in Docker hub, because some commands required registered users to use in for future courses.

Open docker hub

Let me take this Jetty image as an example. First, we enter the input in the input box and press Enter. The search result has been displayed. 

There are three aspects to how to judge the quality of this image.
    The first one, does the image is an official image.
    Second,  look at the downloads number, the larger number is better.
   The third is to see the last update time. more close better. 

 Take the Jetty image as an example, it has an official logo, its download is 10M, and the last update was 19 hours ago. sothat image is a very high-quality image.

Alpine is the smallest Linux mirror. You can create your own image for the production environment based on this. 
The advantage is that you can control the number of packages. 
Your image size will be small.
And the second,   few packages are more secure.
    We click on this link and we will see all available mirror tags.
    We can click on the Source link to enter the dockerfile page, you can modify it according to this dockerfile and create your own dockerfile.
