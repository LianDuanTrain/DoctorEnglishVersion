  Let me introduce the difference between container and image:
    Simply put, a container is a running image. the image is a blueprint for the container 

 Multiple containers can be based on one image. 
For example, Jetty image, we start multiple containers based on Jetty image in a docker engine.
    We can also see how many layers of the image . For example, the Jetty image has four layers.
 When starting the containers based on this image, each container has a readable and writable file layer. Of course, if you stop the container,  readable and writable leayer will be lost.
    
    How to save some persistent content in the container. I will be introduced in future courses.
